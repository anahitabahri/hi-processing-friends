        I have many obsessions, but there’s this one thing that people associate me with, whether the person is a close friend or an acquaintance who happens to be an Instagram follower: l’entrecote, or steak frites!
    </p>

    <p>
        As a superfan of steak frites, I’m always on the lookout for my new favorite steak spot. There are many things I take into consideration, like...
        <ul>
            <li>do i get fries?</li>
            <li>is there sauce involved?</li>
            <li>how about wine?</li>
            <li>and, most importantly, how tasty is the steak?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        How about those who review steakhouses on Yelp? What factors may influence a user when rating a restaurant? Why would a user give a restaurant 3 stars over 5? Does the service matter? Quality of the food? Perhaps the price?
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout this project, I try to uncover trends in the steak realm by exploring the most frequent words per rating (1-5 stars), uncovering various topics for the review text (overall and per rating), extracting words similar to a few of the most frequent words within the reviews, among other techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
        As someone who is relatively new to the data science realm, I haven’t been able to answer all of these questions just yet. I have, however, most certainly begun tackling these questions.
