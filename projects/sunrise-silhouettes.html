        My guide is a digital web experience (soon to potentially be a physical zine) that dives into the idea of **masks**, focusing on the metaphorical social and psychological lenses around identity. It explores how we present ourselves to others, revealning and concealing aspects of identity as relationships progress. It illustrates the slow process of unmasking and opening up, using a series of poems to capture that shift from guarded to vulnerable.

        My project plays with sunrise metaphors and changing gradients to visually show this journey. Along the way, there’s a mix of warmth and coolness that mirrors emotional shifts, and light and dark as symbols of the different stages of revealing yourself. The theme of masks is central, exploring how we let our guard down over time. At the end, there’s a little invitation for reflection, asking the reader to think about their own masks. I also wrote everything in lowercase to create a sense of intimacy and informality.

        One of the goals of my guide was to gently invite readers to reflect on their own experiences of masking/unmasking through personal narrative and poetry. In an ideal world, there would’ve been a mirror involved, where there’d be an additional layer of reflection.
