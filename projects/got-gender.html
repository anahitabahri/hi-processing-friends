    <h1>gender imbalance on game of thrones</h1>
    <p><em>a sociolinguistic analysis of GOT’s script data</em></p>

    <p>
        There has been much debate about sexism on Game of Thrones, a medieval fantasy epic based on the book series “A Song of Ice and Fire.” Headlines over the years include:
        <ul>
            <li>Games of Thrones: Where sexual violence and misogyny are good news for women</li>
            <li>Does 'Game Of Thrones' Have A Misogyny Problem?</li>
            <li>Another year, another debate about sexism on Game Of Thrones</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        What started off as a male-dominated fantasy drama, however, has turned into a story of female empowerment. Progress and growth has been shown in female character development, from powerful women fighting for the throne, to characters whose painful experiences have molded them into more confident and strong women.

    <p>
        Are these recent themes of female empowerment, growth, and progress reflected in the scripts? In addition, how does the language differ between genders? Does the gender of the scriptwriter affect this in any way? Through this project, I answer some of these questions.
