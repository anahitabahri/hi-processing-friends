    <h1>field notes and feral tales</h1>
    <p><em>parallel archives of berlin</em></p>

    <p>
        Documenting Berlin through parallel perspectives, this multimedia installation weaves together human field notes and animal narratives. A central archive box contains cyanotypes, photographs, and notes, while four video screens share stories of urban species adapting to city infrastructure and climate change: a car-dwelling marten, a displaced sparrow, a territorial frog, and a season-confused hedgehog. Their stories reveal how Berlin's transformations affect both its human and non-human inhabitants.
    </p>

    <p>
        This multimedia installation explores urban wildlife adaptation through multiple documentation methods. The piece consists of:
        <ul>
            <li>Four synchronized video screens displaying 30-second narratives from animal perspectives</li>
            <li>A custom-built archive box housing cyanotype prints, field photographs, and handwritten notes</li>
            <li>Curated specimens and artifacts collected during urban exploration</li>
            <li>Accompanying text connecting each species' story to broader themes of climate change and urban infrastructure</li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>

    <p>
        The installation invites viewers to consider how Berlin's changing environment affects its often-overlooked inhabitants, creating an archive that documents both human observation and imagined animal experiences of urban transformation.
