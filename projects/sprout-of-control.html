    <p><em>the garden that talks back</em></p>

        My project lives at the intersection of creative coding, physical computing, and fabrication. Your girl learned all about laser cutting to create the physical controller - a nifty little box adorned with flower buttons that bring a virtual garden to life on screen. Grow your garden by creating flowers, and once you hit a magical threshold (between 10-20, randomly set), you’ll be rewarded with a sassy note. It’s not your typical garden. It comes with a mix of pop culture easter eggs and playful humor, including notes from yours truly and a few quirky contributions from Claude.AI.

        Why did I create this project? It was all about skills building and having fun. I aimed to keep things light, cute, and playful, while embedding my own voice into the experience. At the showcase, I got some great feedback. People have even suggested it could be turned into a play therapy device! So, who knows what's next? Stay tuned!

        While the physical controller offers the full experience, you can still enjoy the sassy garden <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/anacheetah/full/qMSzjMqQO">here</a>!
