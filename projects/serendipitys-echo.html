    <h1>serendipity’s echo</h1>

    <p>
        This project started with my exploration of serendipity - how we notice patterns, make meaning, and find magic in everyday moments. The form itself came from a serendipitous observation: card decks kept appearing in my own life and research. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The deck I created invites three kinds of shifts:
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">disrupting digital defaults</span>: creating space for non-algorithmic (or tech-related) discovery and reflection in an age of curated recommendations</li>
            <li><span class="bold">activating awareness</span>: inviting users to develop their own practice of intentional noticing</li>
            <li><span class="bold">bridging individual & collective</span>: offering prompts that work both as personal reflection tools and conversation starters</li>
        </ol> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Through wandering and wondering, the project evolved into a set of prompts that invite others to pause and notice the world around them - not through an app or screen, but through direct engagement with their environment and experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ll dig into my research process shortly, but I want to flag that it’s central to all the details behind this card deck. My goal was to recreate the experience I had — daily practice of noticing and reflection through writing, although there is no prescription on how one might reflect through these cards. A welcome note was drafted, though:
    </p>

    <div class="snippet">
        <p>
            welcome to serendipity’s echo, a card deck born from wandering and wondering… 
        </p>
        <p>
            maybe you're like me—forever caught between looking for signs and questioning if we're just really good at connecting dots that were never meant to be connected. these cards aren't about finding absolute answers. they're an invitation to pause and notice the magic hiding in plain sight, those small moments that slip through the cracks of our everyday routines.
            there are no right or wrong ways to use these cards. feel free to explore them in whatever way resonates with you. here are some suggestions to get you started.
        </p>
        <p>
            solo:
            <ul>
                <li>draw one as your daily lens</li>
                <li>place near your workspace as a noticing prompt</li>
                <li>use during creative blocks or transitions</li>
                <li>journal with the prompts</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            with others:
            <ul>
                <li>begin gatherings with a collective draw</li>
                <li>spark conversations over coffee</li>
                <li>weave stories from shared observations</li>
                <li>create art inspired by the prompts</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            happy noticing,
            <br>

        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        My intended audience would primarily be people seeking more mindful ways of moving through the world. More on primary audiences:
        <ul>
            <li>mindfulness-curious individuals looking to develop a practice of noticing</li>
            <li>people feeling digital fatigue and seeking analog alternatives</li>
            <li>friends and small groups wanting meaningful conversation starters (inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq3FZ2dS9NCJ_znAy22-JaQmaAhME37He4IT4Fc1eOBHmjRRxfw">we're not really strangers</a> type decks)</li>
            <li>those drawn to spiritual tools but seeking something more grounded in everyday observation</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, I named the deck “serendipity’s echo.” 
        <ul>
            <li>“serendipity” captures the core theme, which was my research topic</li>
            <li>“echo” suggests ripple effects, responses, reflections</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
